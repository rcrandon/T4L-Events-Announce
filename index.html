                        Her prior research includes capturing adverse symptoms of endocrine therapy, identifying scalable tools for early diagnosis of potentially debilitating side effects, understanding health patterns and comorbidities in breast cancer survivors, and exploring strategies to address weight management.

To do so, she collaborates with a multidisciplinary team conducting metabolic reprogramming interventions and cardiometabolic strategies at JHUSOM. She is also planning studies to understand and improve body composition in breast cancer survivors, pinpoint clinical and CT derived biomarkers that can predict response to lifestyle interventions, and clarify the underlying obesity gene signatures that may impact cancer outcomes and survivorship. 
                        
                        Before joining the Johns Hopkins faculty in July 2019, Dr. Sheng completed her fellowship in medical oncology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.

                    <p>Following a diagnosis of an aggressive form of breast cancer, or Can’t-cer as she calls it, Tiah Tomlin-Harris vowed to God that if she made it through breast cancer, she would help as many women as she could fight and survive breast cancer, particularly Black women, who are disproportionately impacted by this disease.
